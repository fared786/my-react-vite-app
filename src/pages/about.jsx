          <h2 className="h5">Work Process and my Role</h2>
          <p>
            I began by decomposing this project into user-facing flows (storefront, registration/login, cart/checkout)
            and operational tooling (admin product management). This allowed parallel work with clear boundaries and a
            shared design language (Bootstrap components, utility classes, and form patterns). We agreed on a single
            data model for products and a canonical user shape (<code>{'{ name, email, phone, password }'}</code>) to
            minimise integration friction between pages.
          </p>
     
          <p>
            My role was to ship features iteratively: the Admin panel seeded and edited products (including a
            “Featured” flag), which the Home and Products pages consumed immediately; meanwhile, the Register/Dashboard
            flow established validation, accessibility, and feedback patterns that we reused across forms.
          </p> 
        </section>

        {/* Project Highlights — 1–3 paragraphs */}
        <section className="mt-4">
          <h2 className="h5">Project Highlights</h2>
          <p>
            A key highlight is the Admin-to-Storefront pipeline: products edited in the Admin UI persist to
            <code> localStorage</code> and drive the storefront in real time, including a lightweight “Featured”
            mechanism surfaced on the landing page. This demonstrates state sharing across independent pages without a
            backend, while keeping the code modular (<em>storefront helpers</em> read from a single source of truth).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also focused on user experience and accessibility. Forms use native HTML5 validation enhanced with
            client-side polish: show/hide password toggles, a strength meter, inline invalid feedback, and an
            <em>aria-live</em> error summary for screen readers. Success states are communicated via Bootstrap toasts,
            and patterns (labels, help text, keyboard navigation) are consistent throughout to meet the marking guide’s
            high-distinction criteria.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Challenges Faced — 1–3 paragraphs */}
        <section className="mt-4">
          <h2 className="h5">Challenges Faced</h2>
          <p>
            Our largest early challenge was keeping data models consistent across pages. Some pages initially saved
            <code>fullName</code> while others expected <code>name</code>, and our product seed lacked a “featured”
            field. We resolved this by introducing normalisers that canonicalise data on read and by updating all save
            paths to write a single, agreed-upon shape. This eliminated subtle bugs like empty dashboard greetings or
            featured grids showing as blank.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second challenge was ensuring the multi-page Vite build worked identically in development and when served
            from XAMPP. We fixed incorrect HTML shells (e.g., loading <code>home.jsx</code> on the dashboard page),
            added all pages to <code>vite.config.js</code> inputs, and documented a build/copy checklist. Hard refresh
            and cache-busting tips were included to avoid stale bundles during marking.
          </p>

        {/* Implementation Notes (optional, helpful for markers) */}

          <h2 className="h5">Implementation Notes</h2>
          <p>
            This app is intentionally multi-page to demonstrate routing-free navigation in Vite. Each page has its own
            HTML shell that loads a dedicated React entry file. Shared UI (Navbar, Scroll-to-Top) and helpers (cart,
            storefront, formatting) live under <code>src/components</code> and <code>src/lib</code>. Data persistence
            uses <code>localStorage</code> only; passwords are stored locally for demo purposes and must not be used in
            production without hashing and server-side auth.
